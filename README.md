# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee wanted us to make a program that will read a .csv file and output the following:

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast
2. Get a complete list of candidates who recieved votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate and county received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won and county votes.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
6. Determine the county with the largest turnout

## Election-Audit Results
The analysis of the election show that:
- 369,711 votes were cast
  - Jefferson county had 38,855 votes (10.5%)
- Denver county had 306,055 votes (73.8%)
- Arapahoe county had 24,801 votes (6.7%)
